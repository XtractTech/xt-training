# xt-training

Utilities for training deep learning models in pytorch and scikit-learn, developed by [Xtract AI](https://xtract.ai/).

The xt-training package has been built by extending the core functionality of pytorch. Core pytorch components (such as datasets/dataloaders, modules, loss functions, optimizers, and schedulers) are defined by the user in the same way, with xt-training providing a layer on top to provide more repeatable, efficient, and better organized code, logging, and experiment management.
